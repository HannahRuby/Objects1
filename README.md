Objects
Overview
Objects are a way to group information about a thing together. They're a way to represent a particular thing, like a blog post, or a spaceship, or a person, and all of the properties you might want to record related to it.

For example, a person object might have a name, age, and favourite colour. A car object might have a make, model, and colour. A blog post might have a title, an author, and post content.

Creating objects
‚õ≥Ô∏è In a new index.html file, add a script tag containing a console.log. Open the file in your browser and check the console to see the output.

console.log("Hello world!");
 
‚õ≥Ô∏è Create an object called person with a name, age, and favourite colour. Log the object to the console.

const person = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 30,
  favouriteColour: "red",
};

console.log(person);
 
You can also log objects using the console.table method, which will display the object in a table format.

console.table(person);
 
Accessing properties
You can access properties on an object using the dot notation. The dot notation is how you access specific properties of an object.

const person = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 30,
  favouriteColour: "red",
};

console.log(person.name); // Output: Bob

console.log(person.age); // Output: 30

console.log(person.favouriteColour); // Output: red
 
Adding properties
You can add properties to an object by assigning a value to a new property.

const person = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 30,
  favouriteColour: "red",
};

person.favouriteFood = "pizza";

console.log(person.favouriteFood); // Output: pizza
